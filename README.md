# Photo-extractor
A program that extracts photos that at the same page with selected word.

This project was made for a certificate program but I refactor it's some of the lines for using program out of the certificate site's own system. Feel free to use and change it. 

* ___I couldn't upload image folders but you can create directories like same in the main.ipynb in your local device or simply change the directories in the main.ipynb___

* ___Before run <span title="pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'src/tesseract_documents/tesseract.exe'">second line of code</span> , you should download tesseract ocr that suitable for your device from [this link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki), and edit the path in the main.ipynb___

If you have any trouble for implementing program for your system [this is](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emircanduzenli/) my linkedin account, you can contact me anytime.
